## Gender prediction from Facebook statuses using character-level language models 

In this project, we implemented a character-based CNN as well as an LSTM language model as feature extractors on a collection of someone's Facebook statuses to predict their gender. We have also applied character base Kernel SVM and Ada Boost CNN for the sake of comparison. 

### Data 

The dataset includes 30 million status updates from 3.5 million users which is collected from the mypersonality app, a third-party facebook quiz.
