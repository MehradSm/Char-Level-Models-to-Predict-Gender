## Gender prediction from Facebook statuses using character-level language models 

In this project, we implemented a character-based CNN as well as an LSTM language model as feature extractors on a collection of someone's Facebook statuses to predict their gender. We have also applied character base Kernel SVM and Ada Boost CNN for the sake of comparison. 

### Data 

The dataset includes 30 million status updates from 3.5 million users which is collected from the mypersonality app, a third-party facebook quiz. 

### Code
The code is divided to four categories:

1. The [Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/blob/master/Preprocessing.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook contains the code to preprocess the raw data. 
2. The [Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/blob/master/Regression.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook contains the linear regression methods
3. The [Random_Forest.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/blob/master/Random_Forest.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook contains the random forest regression model. 
4. The [Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/tree/master/Gradient%20Boosting) file contains MATLAB files to implement gradient boosting method.
